# COP-3502c
Computer Science 1  (Data Structures and Algorithms 1) C Projects with heavy focus on data structures and some algorithms.


### Project 1: 
This assignment is based on a class of problem solved in enterprise computing; extraction, transformation, and loading. This is often referred to as ETL. The inputs will be data extracted from a leading aviation industry data and consulting firm, GCR. (See GCR.com for additional data.) The data is in a well known format where each data element is separated from the previous and following data elements by using a comma. It should be noted that this method of data manipulation is extremely common. The explicit order of the data fields and the desired outputs are defined in the "Specifications".








### Project 3:
An extension of Project 1.Parse airport CSV files into a data structure. Convert latitude and longitude from sexagesimal degrees to decimal degrees. Bitmask a string into binary for binary tree insertion. Place airport data structure into a binary search tree and sort by airport ID or latitude.
