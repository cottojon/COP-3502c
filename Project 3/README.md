### Objective
As discussed in Project 1 many ETL (extraction, transformation, and loading)
problems parse data files wherein the data fields is separated by commas. This
assignment is a continuation of that process - with an additional two steps. The first
step is to convert the input file’s latitude and longitude from sexagesimal (base 60)
degrees to decimal degrees. The second step to place parsed airport data into a binary search tree 
and sort airports alphabetically (LOCId) and sort the airports geographically ( plan a
route from south to north, all the while flying over land).





#### Added from project 1 
•	Parse airport CSV files into a data structure. Convert latitude and longitude from sexagesimal degrees to decimal degrees. 
Bitmask a string into binary for binary tree insertion. Place airport data structure into a binary search tree and sort by airport ID or latitude.



####  Inputs
There are two basic inputs, the input file name, and the input file data sort order defined
below. The input file data is defined below.
